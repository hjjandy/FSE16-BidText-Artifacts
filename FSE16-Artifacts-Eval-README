1. Directories and Files
  - Source code: BidText-Source
  - Binaray: BidText-Bin
  - Test Apps: BidText-TestApps
    - Motivation : corresponding to the motivation example
    - Propagation-3.2.2  : coresponding to the example 
      in Section 3.2.2
    - Result-5.3.1  : corresponding to the example described 
      in Section 5.3.1
    - Casestudy-5.3.2 : corresponding to the case described 
      in Section 5.3.2
    - Others  : corresponding to the 100 apps used to calculate 
      false positives (Table 1)

2. How to run
  - Make sure Java 7 or 8 (amd64) has been installed and the path
    to java is correctly set.
  - Start a terminal
  - Go to BidText-Bin
  - If the user wants to change the maximum heap memory for 
    JVM (used in option -Xmx) and the timeout setting for 
    BidText, please modify file "bidtext.prop"
  - Use command "RUN <APK path>" to run on arbitary APK files
    - The results (if any) will be generated in folder 
      "<APK path>.bidtext"
  - For several special cases used in the paper, please use 
    the following command directly
    - "Motivation"  :  corresponding to the motivation example
    - "Propagation-3.2.2"  : coresponding to the example 
      in Section 3.2.2
    - "Result-5.3.1"  : corresponding to the example described 
      in Section 5.3.1
    - "Casestudy-5.3.2" : corresponding to the case described 
      in Section 5.3.2
    - "Eval-100"  : corresponding to the 100 apps used to calculate 
      false positives (Table 1)
  - The file names of the tests may change even for the same results.
    For example, the Casestudy-5.3.2 generates 2.HTTP.txt on Ubuntu but 
    651.HTTP.txt on Windows.	
  - The commands work for both Windows and Unix platforms. They have 
    been well tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.04.

3. Notes
  - Because BidText requires a huge amount of memory to perform analysis,
    users are expected to allocate enough memory for BidText by changing
    MAX_JAVA_HEAP in bidtext.prop to a larger size (at least 12GB). In 
    addition, the VM is pre-configured with a memory size of 5GB. Users 
    should change it to a larger size.
